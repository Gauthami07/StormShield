# StormShield
Predicting Power Grid Disruptions from Solar Storm
Solar storms, driven by solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), can release massive bursts of energy and charged particles toward Earth. These phenomena can disturb Earth's magnetic field, potentially disrupting power grids, GPS systems, communication networks, and satellites.

# Goal
Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict disruption levels

# Dataset 
This kaggle dataset simulates historical solar flare characteristics — such as flare class, wind speed, and geomagnetic indices — to help build models that predict the severity of power grid disruption.
Rows: 1,000 simulated solar storm events
Columns: 9 features including both physical measurements and a disruption severity label
